* make autonomouses relative to starting position (giving a field-absolute position)
* more autonomouses
* make 30s check inline with raising it -- leave the others functioning before then

* please separate out subsystems into files, make a full hardware description file with instance to pass around, and make Robot super simple and mostly concerned with Joystick commands or starting other subsystems
* move to a subsystem/command architecture
